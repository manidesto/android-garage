My playground to try out interesting things in the android eco-system.

**If you are looking for the scrolling demo mentioned in [this blog post](http://nerds.headout.com/fix-horizontal-scrolling-in-your-android-app/), it has been extracted out into its [own repo here](https://www.github.com/okmanideep/scrolling-demo)**

## NOTE
Most of the functionality may not work if you clone and build it yourself since they might be depending on some secret keys or tokens during build time.

### Current Experiment
Trying out kotlin for android
